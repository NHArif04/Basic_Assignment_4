Here's a brief description of how the JavaScript functionality is implemented in the provided code:

The updateClock() function is defined to update the clock's display. It retrieves the clock element from the HTML using document.getElementById('clock').

Inside the updateClock() function, the current time is obtained using the Date() object. The getHours(), getMinutes(), and getSeconds() methods are used to retrieve the hours, minutes, and seconds from the current time.

Leading zeros are added to the hours, minutes, and seconds if necessary using a ternary operator. This ensures that each segment of the time is displayed with two digits (e.g., 02 instead of 2).

The formatted time string is created by concatenating the hours, minutes, and seconds together with colons separating them.

The textContent property of the clock element is updated with the formatted time string, effectively displaying the time in the clock.

The updateClock() function is called initially to initialize the clock's display with the current time.

The setInterval() function is used to call the updateClock() function every second (1000 milliseconds). This ensures that the clock is updated continuously to reflect the current time.
